Adafruit Scoreboard for 64 pixel LED

=======================================================================================

This program controls an Adafruit Matrix to generate scoreboard graphics based on live NBA schedules.
Credit for the underlying techniques goes to the Adafruit forums, StackOverflow, and Reddit.
The program connects to local WiFi (with plans for future configurability) and queries the official NBA scores API,
which returns details for today's games. Currently, the program is configured to display data for the Celtics;
a future version will allow selection of any team. If the team is not currently playing, the next game is determined
using a hardcoded schedule and compared to real time. Once the conditions are met and the data is confirmed,
the information is passed to functions within the draw_tools library. This library bridges the application logic and
the display by using displayio to define a matrix, and by creating bitmaps, palettes, and patterns that are rendered
on the display.
